Ply.py: The lexer that converts a java file to tokens
We have 6 tokens:
1)Keyword
2)Identifier
3)Literals
4)Separator
5)Comments
6)Operator


As a token is read its count is incresed and it is added to the set of its token type
Uncommenting the line print(tok) can print every token that is calculated
Illegal entry is made for variables that start with a number literals
